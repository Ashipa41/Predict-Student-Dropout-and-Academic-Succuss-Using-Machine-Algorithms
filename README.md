# Predict-Student-Dropout-and-Academic-Succuss-Using-Machine-Algorithms
This project uses several machine learning algorithms for predicting student dropout and academic success. The process involves data collection, literature review, methodology, and implementing machine learning models in R (programming language).

# Abstract
Higher education establishments gather a great deal of data about their students, which offers a great deal of opportunity to produce understanding, information, insight, and monitoring. both academic achievement and school dropout rates. Dropouts in higher education have a direct influence on the lives of students and their families, higher education institutions, and society at large. They also impede economic growth, competitiveness, employment, and productivity. Academic information on enrollment and performance at the conclusion of the first and second semesters is included in the dataset that is being described. Machine learning models Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, and Nave Bayes.

The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model's performance, and the outcomes for each student variety, specifically sensitivity, balanced accuracy, specificity, and F1_score, were compared. There was also a comparison of the models' general statistics. Random Forest was found to outperform the others by a small margin.

# Overview

Academic achievement in higher education is necessary for a deeper sense of purpose in life, as well as for improving economic growth, social justice, and job prospects. The fact that dropouts need to be addressed in order to increase their success is the most troublesome issue facing higher education institutions. (Dekker et al., 2009)There's no consensus definition for the term "dropout". Depending on the definition of dropout, the data source, and the computation method, the percentage of students who drop out differs amongst researches. Early vs. late dropout is a common basis for analysis in research literature. It is not possible to compare dropout rates amongst universities due to discrepancies in reporting. We define dropouts in this study from a micro-perspective, where changes in an institution or field are considered dropouts regardless of when they occur.

# Data Source

The dataset was retrieved from an open-source website, uci.edu. It consists of 36 attributes and 4424 rows created from a higher education institution, including information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic success.
